## 1 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  

### 1.1 _Background Information_  
Spiral cleavage is a highly conserved embryonic pattern among spiralians, characterized by alternating cell divisions along the animal-vegetal axis. 
This cleavage program enables precise cell fate mapping across species, providing a powerful framework for comparative developmental studies. 
Differences in blastomere size at the four-cell stage distinguish equal and unequal cleaving taxa, influencing mechanisms of D quadrant specification.
### 1.2 _Rationale_ 
The prevailing hypothesis suggests that unequal cleavage and cytoplasmic determinant inheritance accelerate development compared to inductive mechanisms in equal cleavers. 
However, this hypothesis is based on heuristic phylogenetic analyses that predate modern molecular techniques, necessitating a formal reevaluation.
### 1.3 _Objectives_   
This study employs formal phylogenetic analysis to reassess the evolution of spiral cleavage and the role of cytoplasmic determinants in D quadrant specification.


## 2 STUDY DESIGN  

#### 2.1 Construct a backbone tree using existing transcriptome-based phylogenies - use file Bind_Constraint.Rmd and accompanying tree files



#### 2.2 Compile reference topology trees for both Annelids and Mollusks using Open Tree of Life - use file OTL_trees.rmd



#### 2.3 Creating subtrees and determining branch lengths

2.3.1 We first determined the distance from the LCA to the taxon with a known branch length (N). In cases where subclades included more than one taxon with known branch lengths, N was calculated as the mean distance from the LCA to each of these taxa. 
We then distributed the length N equally across branch segments (i.e., branches between internal and tip nodes) leading from the LCA to tips without branch-length information.

2.3.2	For several subtrees, we reconstructed the topology using Lifemap NCBI. These were cases in which the tree had multiple known branch lengths and the Lifemap tree had fewer polytomies than the OTL topology. 
These trees had branch lengths calculated using the same rules and the new topology. 


#### 2.4 Constructing tree for analysis

2.4.1 Single branches and sister taxa (i.e. taxa for which a subtree was not needed) were manaully placed into the backbone tree first

2.4.2 Each subtree was placed on the backbone tree by replacing the "known" branch with the full subtree

2.4.3 After each subtree was placed, the tree was checked to ensure that the branches were topologically correct and that the branch length was correct.

#### 2.5 Prune and make tree ultrametric - use file prune_and_ultrametric.Rmd and constraint_SVG_24r.tre



#### 2.6 Resolving polytomies and Ape-ACE analysis for each character of interest
2.6.1 Run for cleavage state using cleavage_state_analysis.Rmd and ultrametric_full.tre and matrix_cleavage_09_03.csv

2.6.2 Run for larval type using larval_type_analysis_09_11.Rmd and ultrametric_full.tre and matrix_larval_09_03.csv

2.6.3 Run for egg size using egg_size_analysis_09_11.Rmd and ultrametric_full.tre and matrix_egg_diam_09_03.csv


#### 2.7 SIMMAP analysis using Simmap2.R and working_phy_pruned.tre and corresponding csv files


#### 2.8 Calculate covariance between traits using fitPagel_covariance_final.Rmd and working_phy_pruned.tre and corresponding csv files
